I never really tracked the books I've read. It's been on my todo list for quite some time now.
Even though this list is not complete, I am hoping for it to grow more in the future.

- Babel by R. F. Kuang
- The Dawn of Everything by David Graeber and David Wengrow
- Disabling Intelligences by Rua M. Williams
- Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card

## Past

- The Martian by Andy Weir
- Deep Work by Cal Newport
