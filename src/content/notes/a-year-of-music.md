For the past few years, I have been playing with the idea of starting my own metal band. Now that I was able to find a bit more balance between my professional and personal life, I believe is the time to give it a try.

I have created a set of capabilities I want to acquire to get better at performing and writing music. For the next year, I will spending my time to get better at them.

First, I want to truly get better at playing the rhythm guitar. That means that I want to be able to play and write riffs with ease. Specially from those bands that have influenced my art since always. Including Trivium, Killswitch Engage, In Flames, and Breaking Benjamin.

Second, I want to get better at singing. And since the songs from Trivium are withing my current range, I will get started with them. This means to be able to take care of my voice while doing guturals. This is a long term investment and I cannot afford to blow out my voice.

Third, I need to be able to sing and play at the same time. At this moment, this is not as difficult but I believe that the more difficult the riffs get, the harder this will become.

Fourth, I want to be able to record and mix my own songs and the covers I make. I have already setup to do so with Kubuntu + Ardour. This, I believe, is the one I require more practice since it is all pretty new to me.

With all these steps, I am pretty confident I can make it happen. I will update this note once every week to document my progress. Hopefully one day I have the space and time to post videos as well.
