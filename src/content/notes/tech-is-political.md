It's surely amusing to see the current state of tech in 2025. In one side, people are creating their own AI partners with whom they develop emotional attachment and on the other, people are using tech for "defence" being the enablers of a genocide.

Every now and then though, while checking the comments of posts, I see people being annoyed at how political tech is becoming.
