For the past 10 years I mostly documented my life using social media. I would spend time thinking about the process of taking photos, add the right caption, and post them as soon as possible. Just in the last year, I got less and less energy, time, and interest into following this process every time something interesting was happening. This, along with all the data privacy concerns of these platforms, I decided I want to regain control of my own data.

I took the first steps to do so by deleting the Facebook App around 4 years ago from all my personal devices. I do not keep any session open and I added as much friction as needed to prevent me from accessing often. I also deleted Twitter and TikTok. It has been harder to delete Instagram since it is my go to communication platform with friends.

My workflow used to be much different to what it is now. In the very beginning I used to put the effort to organise my albums in Facebook with date, location, and description. Then I moved to Instagram, where I would post photos on my feed whenever an important even would happen. Eventually with stories, it would become much easier to press a button and show everything the exact moment it was happening, set highlights, and create a "permanent" record of what I once lived.

Over the years, it became evident that most social media platforms make everything they can to keep you locked. They reduce the friction to provide information to their servers, and give you a "free" service that benefits from having your network around. With more AI used, they also need to leverage the data they are getting, not only for advertisement but also for training their own AI models.

With that in mind, I will start posting more on this website instead and only occasionally post on other platforms.
