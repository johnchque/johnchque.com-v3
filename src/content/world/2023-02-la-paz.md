I fall in love over and over with the colors of home. As I go back every year, I realise how important it is to me to be surrounded by mountains.

For quite some time I feel as posting these photos in social media doesn't mean much. Because these photos mean more to me than to anyone else. They are a memory of home. A memory of the empty spaces that I would always see from the distance.

## Notes

- It is definitely a good idea to get food from the last exit from El Alto, since the tour leaves relatively early and there are very few places to buy things from there on.
- Sunscreen is essential. While the weather was good, meaning sunny and had snowed recently, this meant that the snow would reflect the light. Without sunscreen be ready to get some sun burn.
- Most tours will give you the gear to snowboard but you will need to walk from the base of the mountain with your gear and the walk may be a bit tiring. Even when you reach the top, there is almost no infrastructure for snowboarding, so once you go down the hill you have to walk back up.
