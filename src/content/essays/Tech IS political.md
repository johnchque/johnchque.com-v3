It's surely amusing to see the current state of tech in 2025. In one side, people are creating their own AI partners with whom they develop emotional attachment and on the other, people are using tech for "defence" being the enablers of a genocide.

Every now and then though, while checking the comments of posts, I see people being annoyed at how political tech is becoming. Which reminds me of a comment a friend of mine made, when I said that I preferred not to pay attention to politics: "Being apolitical is a privilege only few people can afford to have". And as I was writing my master thesis on justice and LLMs, this idea that many tech people are unaware of the consequences of the tech they build, was just a confirmation of this statement.

It makes sense though, right before COVID, many software engineers were living their best life (myself included). We could work remotely from wherever we wanted, we had good salaries as it was somehow still a market with more demand than offers. It felt there was enough space to do whatever you wanted without really caring what tech you were building. Companies like Google had their motto as "don't be evil" while offering free services for people, and Microsoft offering support to Linux and integrating into their system.

It felt as if there was an innate altruistic intention to building tech. We were sold the idea that we could change the world through technology. We just had to build more and better for free and for everyone to see.

However, the more people got into tech with not only the good intention to make a difference but with the promise for a good salary, we could see less demand for talent.
