Reflections on living in Denmark for 3 years, the changes and learnings coming from a different continent.

Back in September 2021, I moved to Austria for a masters at University of Salzburg in a joint degree with Aalborg University in Copenhagen. In February 2022, I moved to Copenhagen in the second semester of my masters. These are the changes and learnings coming from a different continent.

## Hard to know what to expect
For the first months of the masters I had very few time to reflect over all the changes I was going through. From food, including how different the salt was, to studying in a very multi cultural setting. In a way, I think that I was overwhelmed without really acknowledging it.

When I had to move to Denmark, after 6 months living in Salzburg, I was in the middle of exams. Of course I had to prepare for some months to gather all the documentation needed to move to the new country. But I had no time to reflect over the change. Yes, sure, I had arranged my means of transportation, the housing, the university documentation, and asked questions around what to expect in Denmark.

I think I did not really think of what to expect until I was on the train to Copenhagen.

Once the train made the first stop in Denmark, I could see how different and similar it was to the places I had visited already around Europe. Once we crossed the border, everyone took their masks off (regulations were very serious in Germany back then), and the journey continued as normal.

Not knowing what to expect from a new place where you are going to spend the next year and a half, may be overwhelming. I haven't found a lot of places that describe how it feels to sleep in a new place for the first time, specially with no furniture at thew new place called home. Finding very few places open to buy food on the first night, finding your way to your new place, and even asking for directions when you first arrive.

## Life goes on
I still remember the first morning when I went to the supermarket to buy groceries. The streets were empty (Copenhagen is a very cold and windy city anyway) and I needed to buy the very basics. When I reach the counter, I remember hearing everyone speaking in Danish. For them, it was just another day doing what they had to do. For me, it was a new beginning, maybe getting to see things I never though I would.

Every time I did something for the first time, I was getting into a cycle that never existed in my life. I got to understand that these new things were going to be the new norm, just as much as it was for all the other people around me.
