            I create impact-driven digital solutions with a deep commitment to
            sustainability and social innovation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I have explored the use and development of
            software as a tool to make positive impact. My work falls into the
            categories of ed-tech, digital inclusion and accessibility,
            pro-feminism, computer ethics, and sustainability.
          </p>

            I am currently a Senior Frontend Developer at

            this role, I co-founded multiple organizations and startups, and
            volunteered with several mission-driven initiatives. You can see all
            my previous experience <a href="/bio">here</a>.
